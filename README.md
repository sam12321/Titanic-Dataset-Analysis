# Titanic-Dataset-Analysis
This project deals with the analysis and prediction of the famous titanic dataset using machine learning models
# Goal
The main goal of our project is to first analyse the dataset and perform feature engineering and then create and train different Machine learning models to predict 
which of the people have survived in the test dataset
# Dataset
there are two datasets train and test datasets.
Train Dataset
---------------
contains 12 columns which contain infromation about the passengers and 891 rows
Test Dataset
------
contains 11 columns which contain infromation about the passengers and 419 rows
Test Dataset
